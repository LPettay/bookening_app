I’ve also searched the Databricks workspace app docs. I’m stuck on redirect URI handling inside the workspace iframe and token exchange behavior.  Agenda: 1) Validate my current approach and redirect URIs 2) Troubleshoot token/session handling in the workspace context 3) Confirm roles/tenants mapping and next steps to production  Desired outcome: A clear, production-ready plan and fixes for the redirect/token issues.  Urgency: medium Desired timeframe: Tue–Thu this week between 1–4pm PT (30 minutes)  Attendees: requester@example.com, csm@example.com Background: React SPA + Node backend using @descope/node-sdk; deployed in a Databricks workspace app; current error indicates invalid redirect / session not persisted. Links: https://docs.descope.com/oauth, https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/pull/123 (current implementation), https://example.com/error-screenshot"
