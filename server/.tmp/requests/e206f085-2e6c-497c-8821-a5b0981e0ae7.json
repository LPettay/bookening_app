Agenda: 1) Confirm required scopes and service account vs. user auth 2) Map event fields (attendees, reminders) 3) Review rate limits + retries 4) Approve next steps and timeline  Desired outcome: Leave with a confirmed approach and a short checklist to implement.  Why sync (not email): We’re blocked by ambiguity around scopes and ownership; a quick call will unblock implementation.  Attendees: me <me@example.com>, eng lead <eng@example.com> Urgency: medium Desired timeframe: next Tue–Thu Availability: 9:00–12:00 PT any of those days Links: PR draft https://example.com/pr/123, notes https://example.com/notes"
