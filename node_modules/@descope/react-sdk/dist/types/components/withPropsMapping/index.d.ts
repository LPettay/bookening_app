 * withPropsMapping is a React HOC that adapts React props to work seamlessly
 * with web components by setting attributes and properties.
 *
 * - Props ending in `.prop` are set as properties on the web component.
 * - Props ending in `.attr` are transformed to kebab-case and set as attributes on the web component.
 * - All other props are set as kebab-case props
 *
 * This resolves attribute/property behavior differences in React 19.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29037
